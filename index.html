                    Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, commonly referred to as Tottenham (/ˈtɒtənəm/)[1][2] or Spurs, is a
                    professional football club in Tottenham, London, England, that competes in the Premier League. Tottenham
                    Hotspur Stadium has been the club's home ground since April 2019, replacing their former home of White
                    Hart Lane, which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site. Their training
                    ground is on Hotspur Way in Bulls Cross in the London Borough of Enfield. Tottenham have played in a
                    first (home) strip of white shirts and navy blue shorts since the 1898–99 season. The club's emblem is a
                    cockerel standing upon a football, with a Latin motto Audere est Facere ("To Dare Is to Do").

                    Founded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, the only non-League club to do so
                    since the formation of the Football League in 1888. Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to
                    achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season. After
                    successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club
                    competition – the European Cup Winners' Cup.[3] They were also the inaugural winners of the UEFA Cup in
                    1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. They have collected
                    at least one major trophy in each of the six decades from the 1950s to 2000s – an achievement only
                    matched by Manchester United.[4][5] In total, Spurs have won two league titles, eight FA Cups, four
                    League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one European Cup Winners' Cup and two UEFA Cups. The club has a
                    long-standing rivalry with nearby club Arsenal, with head-to-head fixtures known as the North London
                    derby.
